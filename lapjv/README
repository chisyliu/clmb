Linear Assignment Problem

 Problems", Computing 38, 325-340 (1987)

This code is not the original version from authors' website. To my knowledge,
there are only two changes:
  1. usage of double precision floating-point numbers for costs, and
  2. a different test for decrease of the objective that prevents endless
     loop when close to the machine precision (thanks to Michael Lewis)

The legal status of the code is most probably best described by the few
sentences from the original website:
