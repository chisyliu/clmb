# Considerations when choosing a global coordinate system for tracking
 - It is desirable to store objects in a global coordinate frame
 - In a detection sense, objects are located in an LLA frame.
 - The LLA frame is nonlinear, with discontinuities
 - The ECEF frame is linear
 - The ECEF frame is not constrained to the earth surface
 - A manual constraint in the ECEF frame is nonlinear
 - Targets should be tracked in a local NED-system


# Algorithm for LLA bboxes

Store targets in LLA
Load clusters from targettree                           // Done
 - Consider overflow
Cluster targets in LLA
Determine cluster mass center in LLA
Set cluster origin in LLA
Transform all cluster targets to NED
Filter in NED
 - Transform reports to NED with cluster origin
Transform each target NED bbox to LLA
 - Overflow LL coords to nearest mean
 - Zero A coord
Store targets with LLA bbox
